# TTS to PnP Cards
Separates TTS Card Dumps into Printable Images

Operation of the program self explanatory and bare bones. Just run the program and select the folder you want to process. It auto detects the images with the correct dimensions once the folder is chosen.
 
Standalone exe available here: https://github.com/HDCharles/TTS-to-PnP-Cards/releases

Its 200MB though, if you have python3 it may be easier to just take the TTStoPnp.py file and run that. Only nonstandard dependency is Numpy.

Use both at your own risk.
