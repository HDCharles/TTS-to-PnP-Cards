# TTS to PnP Cards
Separates TTS Card Dumps into Printable Images
 
Requires python3
 
To run:

1) Open a command prompt (cmd.exe)

2) Navigate to the directory with the python file (type: cd \<path to folder with TTStoPnp.py\>)
 
3) Type: python TTStoPnp.py

Operation of the program self explanatory and bare bones. It auto detects the images with the correct dimensions once the folder is chosen.

Use both at your own risk.
